11		The editing cuts to a conductor and an orchestra in an animated style, it is unclear whether this is specifically used for its connection to the plot or even story of the animation, rather it feels like it is more stripping it of its meaning to insert its nostalgic effect on those watching.

1:17		We get a very short clip of an animated text shown as "Summertime"	Animation
1:50		Here, we see an image of three dancing women's silhouettes. In relationship to the song, it reminded me a lot about the objectification of women by young men, especially through young shows or video games. It might be a large indication that the impact that video games and/or visual culture for people at the time this was written, or maybe just in their childhood, was more than just a distraction that one had that stopped them from being a good partner, as it could even go further to say that video games and/or visual culture corrupted many of the founding ideas of a healthy relationship.

2:08		The dancing women come back, and I feel like this could represent the animation theme as a part of the larger whole, being the montage. The music video as a whole comes together as an amalgamation of clips, and through recurrence, treats each of these recurring clips as just a slip in time, something that comes and goes very easily. I feel like this is also a critique of visual culture, specifically the deteriorating attention span that comes from a lot of modern media like animation or video games. 	Animation
